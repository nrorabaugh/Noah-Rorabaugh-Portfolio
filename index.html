                Hi, I'm Noah. I'm a student at General Assembly Atlanta studying software engineering. Since a young age, I have lived on the south side of Atlanta and I am proud to call the southern capitol home. I enjoy the process of creation as well as the fine art of perfecting systems. I love to have fun, but I love to work, too.
